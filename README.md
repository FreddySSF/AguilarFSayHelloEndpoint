//localhost page will show up and say it can't be found. Return to the debug console in vs sharp and copy + paste the http url ( example: http://localhost:5250 ).
// Open up Postman in your web browser and create a new http request. Paste the http into the request. You type in / and then the name of the controller
// inclding what goes in after the route in parenthesis. With another dash you input the value you wish for {name}. Enter send and the url should output into postman

// Peer Reviewed By: Pedro Castaneda - Freddy did a great job setting up the api.
// His variable inside of the Route() is set up properly and when I make my input in the URL I get the correct response. Great work.
